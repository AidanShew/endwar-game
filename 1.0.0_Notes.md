# Update 1 (Cannon Ball)
## Gameplay Changes
##### Bullet Hell
- After some thinking, I decided to move in the direction of making this game a bullet hell, shoot em up rather than an asteroids based game respective to gameplay.
- The direction of your bullets can now be slightly controlled up to 22.5 degrees left/right by your mouse location relative to your screen width.

### Lives and Health
##### Health
- Added health system, player has 50 HP (Hit Points).
- In "Campaign" big rocks take all HP, small rocks do 5 HP.
- In "Arena" one enemy bullet does 3 HP. 
- HP will be displayed below the points text during gameplay.

##### Lives
- Added lives, player gets 3 lives, after a player dies, one life is taken away but you keep your score.
- After 3 lives are gone, the game ends and you lose your score.

### Horde Mode
##### Arena Changes
- Arena is now called Horde Mode! Arena will now refer to both the Horde mode and the Survival mode.
- Rounds are here! After a set number of enemies are killed, move on to the next round.
- The first round will begin with 5 enemies and will increase from there (5 enemies * (round number + 2))
- Enemies will now stop just outside your location instead of going right on top of you.
- Enemies will now slowly deccelerate towards your position instead of abrubtly stopping.
- If you collide with an enemy, you and the enemy will both die.
- Enemies now spawn in from outside boundaries.
- Added Game Over screen. Will display your score, the round you made it to, and your rank based on your round. There's also two buttons to either replay the mode or quit the game.

##### Campaign Changes

### Notes & Thoughts
I originally wanted to keep this update to just a Health update and some quality of life improvements, however I found it really hard to step away from the keyboard. I finished one problem and thought, man it would be cool to have this too, then added that until I ended up with this large update. I retitled the update to "Cannon Ball" because it's only the first update but it adds so many features including a Health system, proper Horde mode, rounds to both Horde and Survival, statistic tracking, full screen, and so much more!

Different gameplay styles?
Dog Fight: Expansive-ish open zone.
Linear: Parallax background, bullet hell.

## Known Issues
- Some enemies are too scared to enter the arena, so they don't come all at once.
- Code is a bit messy, will clean it up for the next update.
