#### *In-Progress!*: This game is meant to be an extracurricular learning project. This game will be very different closer to its completion. End War is in a very early stage!

# End War
### Story: *Humanity Marches Toward Damnation*
Play as a special forces pilot, Atom, as he's sent to defend humanity's largest space station, the Arm of Edus, from mysterious attackers.

### Controls: *Different Ways to Play*
End War's gameplay is based off of the game "Asteroids", gameplay is similar.
- Propel your ship forwards with the up arrow or "W" key, turn your ship using the left/right arrows or "A"/"D" keys.
- Fire with the Left Mouse Button or Spacebar.
- Return to the main menu with the Escape key. **Does not pause gameplay**

### Features: *Two Modes*
- Play the "Campaign", classic Asteroids gameplay... for now.
- Prove yourself in the "Arena", go toe-to-toe (or ship-to-ship) with an enemy. Keep track of your score in the top left, it'll increase for every kill! See how far you can go.

### Looking Ahead: *What's in the Pipeline*
This is mostly meant to be an extracurricular project while I'm in school, however this will act as a catalyst, a precursor for a series yet-to-come.
Some may see a simple Asteroids-based game, here, I see something much more narratively speaking.

#### **Very realistic goals for the future:**
##### High Priority
- Improved Sprites
- Music and sounds
- Lives and a health system
- "Extinction": Improved horde mode that will replace the Arena.

##### Next-Up (Second in Line)
- Backgrounds
- A gripping 4-part short story, taking full advantage of the "limitations" of an 8-bit Asteroids-based game. Will replace existing Campaign mode.

##### Low Priority
- "Score Attack": High score based mode.
- Ship customization
- Multiplayer

### Final Note: *Not Going Anywhere*
As I said before, I'm in school. I tend to stay focused, this project helps me do just that. In my free time in between homework, this is my go-to hobby.

I can't wait to share new features and assets I'm making at the moment for this project, some of which will come very very soon. As this project progresses, so will my skills and abilities, I'm excited for the future and to see what I can do.

*This game, as well as my career, is committed to the memory of my best friend Jaden (2004-2025).*
