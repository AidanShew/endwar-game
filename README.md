#### *In-Progress!*: This game is meant to be an extracurricular learning project. This game will be very different closer to its completion. End War is in a very early stage!

# End War
### Story: *Humanity Marches Toward Damnation*
Play as a special forces pilot, Atom, as he's sent to defend humanity's largest space station, the Arm of Edus, from mysterious attackers. Campaign coming soon...

### Controls: *Advanced Combat*
- Use WASD to move your ship
- Use 'J' to fire slightly left, 'I'/Spacebar to fire straight up, 'L' to fire slightly right
- Return to the main menu with the Escape key. **Does not pause gameplay**

### Features: *Horde Mode*
- Prove yourself in the "Arena", fight waves of enemies, every 5 rounds will activate a boss battle against a Whirlpool. Good luck.
- Your player stats will be tracked via the main menu, earn your rank:
- Noob (Die within the first round)
- Cadet (Survive the first round)
- Soldier (Survive at least 5 rounds, including defeating the first Whirlpool)
- Hero (Survive more than 10 rounds)
- Champion (Survive more than 20 rounds... Godspeed)

### Looking Ahead: *What's in the Pipeline*
This is mostly meant to be an extracurricular project while I'm in school, however this will act as a catalyst, a precursor for a series yet-to-come.
Some may see a simple game, here, I see something much more narratively speaking.

#### **Very realistic goals for the future:**
##### High Priority
- [x] Lives and a health system (*Added in Update 1.0.0! See update notes.*)
- [ ] Music and sounds (*Some sounds have been added in Update 1.0.0*)
- [x] Improved Sprites
- [ ] "Extinction" (Big Update): Horde mode that will replace the Arena.

##### Next-Up (Second in Line)
- Backgrounds
- A gripping 4-part short story, taking full advantage of the "limitations" of an 8-bit Asteroids-based game. Will replace existing Campaign mode.

##### Low Priority
- "Score Attack": High score based mode.
- Ship customization
- Multiplayer

### Final Note: *Not Going Anywhere*
As I said before, I'm in school. I tend to stay focused, this project helps me do just that. In my free time in between homework, this is my go-to hobby.

I can't wait to share new features and assets I'm making at the moment for this project, some of which will come very very soon. As this project progresses, so will my skills and abilities, I'm excited for the future and to see what I can do.

*This game, as well as my career, is committed to the memory of my best friend Jaden (2004-2025).*
